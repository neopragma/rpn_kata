# Notes

I'm going to do this with JavaScript, starting with the basic RPN engine and
then extending that out to a service, and then a quick front-end.

- set up some base things, disappointed about not being able to reconcile
  linter with the way mocha runs the tests - pre v3 mocha I used to be able to
  import describe and it in order to not leave hanging undefined method refs
  in the test code :-(
